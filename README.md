# CAF plasticity

A collaboration with Alessandra Cambi's lab to study plasticity of tumor microenvironment in solid tumours, specifically myofibroblast-like cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) and inflammatory CAFs (iCAF) upon different combinations of TGFβ and IL1α perturbations. 

The RNA libraries were processed in R as bulk RNA-seq with main focus on identifying differently expressed genes between specific contrasts.

The single-cell dataset analysis was done following the script https://gitlab.cmbi.umcn.nl/kurtg/cafs_sc_analysis, published in https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.26.614950. The data come from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0636-z#data-availability and https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0195-y papers.

The arthritis dataset come from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1263-7 paper on Distinct fibroblast subsets drive inflammation and damage in arthritis by Croft et al., 2019, Nature.
