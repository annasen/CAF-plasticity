# CAF plasticity

A collaboration with Alessandra Cambi's lab to study plasticity of tumor microenvironment in solid tumours, specifically myofibroblast-like cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) and inflammatory CAFs (iCAF) upon different combinations of TGFβ and IL1α perturbations. 

The RNA libraries were processed in R as bulk RNA-seq with main focus on identifying differently expressed genes between specific contrasts.
